# Release Notes

Releases use the following numbering system:
**{major}.{minor}.{incremental}**

* major: Major refactoring or rewrite - make sure you read and test very carefully!
* minor: Breaking change in some circumstances, or a new feature. Read carefully and make sure you understand the impact of the change.
* incremental: A "safe" change / improvement. Should *always* be safe to upgrade.

* **[BC]**: Items marked with [BC] indicate a breaking change that will require updates to your code if you are using that code in your extension.

## Release 3.0.0
Many api calls are updated to use apiv4. This may mean that hooks receive
different parameters (ie apiv4 rather than apiv3 ready)
